# React Native Demo

This folder contains a demo for using tus-js-client inside React Native.
An example application has been built using [Expo](https://expo.io/) for
easier development but tus-js-client does *not* depend on Expo and can be
used without it as tus-js-client only uses React Native APIs.

The main application code where tus uploads are preformed can be found in `App.js`

In order to run this example, invoke following in this directory and follow
the printed instructions:
```
npm install
npm start
```
