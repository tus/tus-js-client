      <p>
        This demo shows tus' support for uploading streams while the data is still arriving. Using
        the controls below you can start recording a video from your webcam which is directly
        uploaded to the specified tus endpoint. This is different from regular file uploads since
        the entire video size is not known in advance. tus' support for
        <a href="https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#upload-defer-length"
          >deferring the upload length</a
        >
        makes this possible.
      </p>
